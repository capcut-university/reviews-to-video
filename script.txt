great reviews.;Grandmaster Marti:I have almost mastered this app completely and don’t want to leave and switch over to something that’s paid when capcut is doing things that every;Grandmaster Marti:other editing service is doing.;Grandmaster Marti:However, there is always room to grow, especially for the editors who’s skills are growing faster and wanting more.;Grandmaster Marti:A few of my recommendations is having more advanced and better options for speed.;Grandmaster Marti:Please add more filters (specifically in the border area),and add ones that are different and will give our videos good quality(I’m pretty sure y’all can come up with something!;Grandmaster Marti:I ask that we get more font options and allow us to use more than 1 animation for out fonts PLEASEE!!;Grandmaster Marti:Those are just a few of my recommendations.;Grandmaster Marti:Now,on to my concerns the app does lag a little,and constantly says that I’m out of storage and I delete a lot of previous edits just to make new ones,and I’m getting concerned that the app will just not be enough for me.;Grandmaster Marti:It’s already taken up most of my storage andI really want it to be worth it,but all these glitches,lags,and thirst for storage is not going to make using this app worth it.;Grandmaster Marti:I hope someone sees this, and I hope you have a great rest of your day/night.;setBgAni:bg_softIn 5s;setBgFilter:blur(1px);changeBg:bg5.jpg -next;miniAvatar:ia_600000054.png -right -next;setFigAni:moveBaF 1s -right;jasᵔᴥᵔ◡̈:I love capcut!;jasᵔᴥᵔ◡̈:I appreciate how everything is free and how you can remove the watermark at the end.;jasᵔᴥᵔ◡̈:so my first recommendation is that you guys should maybe add more animations to both,texts and clips.;jasᵔᴥᵔ◡̈:i do have some recommendations though because i do find some little issues or something i would like to be better/fixed.;jasᵔᴥᵔ◡̈:I have been using this app for like a year now and i think its great and easy to use.;jasᵔᴥᵔ◡̈:maybe you could even add more combos as well.;jasᵔᴥᵔ◡̈:id also think a new great addition would be if there were to be more shakes and stuff.;jasᵔᴥᵔ◡̈:for the texts,i think itd be cool to have more varieties to choose from.;jasᵔᴥᵔ◡̈:and now for clips,i think if you could add more ins and out transitions,it would be fun to be able to have more transitions.;jasᵔᴥᵔ◡̈:i know there's a lot of choices already but i mean that maybe if possible,there could be combos like there is for clips.i think itd look great on edits and would be very useful.;jasᵔᴥᵔ◡̈:sometimes when i make it slower,it looks blury or just doesnt look like it has the same quality as it would with normal speed.;jasᵔᴥᵔ◡̈:another suggestion is to make the speed adjusts cleaner.;jasᵔᴥᵔ◡̈:I dont think theres many shakes to add to your edits so i think more would be cool.;jasᵔᴥᵔ◡̈:i do hsve more recommendations id like to share but i dont really know exactly how to explain it but if you could add/fix those things,i think the app would be 5x better!;setBgAni:bg_down 5s;setBgFilter:blur(1px);changeBg:bg22.jpg -next;miniAvatar:ia_200000354.png -left -next;setFigAni:centerin 1s

KineMaster,but this is still AMAZING.;Lol_what_the_heck:It’s actually a step up from KineMaster, which I did not expect.;Lol_what_the_heck:I’m so happy we are able to delete the watermark at the end, it’s just great.;Lol_what_the_heck:And everything is free! it’s awesome and it’s pretty much everything you need (sadly no animation key thing.) the chroma key is SOO good.;Lol_what_the_heck:I can remove part of my green/pink screen in the background without any pink/green thing on my character or art disappearing!;Lol_what_the_heck:The effects are really nice and aesthetic,and some are just really cool.;Lol_what_the_heck:(some are kinda uhm weird imo) the effects are perfect for edits,the retro or vintage ones have to be my favorite!;Lol_what_the_heck:Also the in and out animations are cool, and there are some that are for the whole duration of the video/photo, which is cool.;Lol_what_the_heck:The customization abilities for the text are great.;Lol_what_the_heck:You can give the text a font,color,some special design (example: making it glow) in and out transitions,animations that last for the duration the text is on the screen,and you can put it in a text box or something,and there are some really cute ones!;Lol_what_the_heck:There is so much I haven’t explored yet, and I know it’ll probably be good.;Lol_what_the_heck:I recommend this app for beginners, pros, anyone really.;Lol_what_the_heck:5 stars, 10/10 I love the app Sincerely, -a person;setBgAni:bg_down 5s;setBgFilter:blur(1px);changeBg:Loading_img.jpg -next;miniAvatar:ia_700000274.png

CapCut!;🌸𝔸𝕚𝕪𝕒𝕟𝕒🌸:So the first suggestion I was thinking of is a feature where you can add graphs to you keyframes to make them look smoother.;🌸𝔸𝕚𝕪𝕒𝕟𝕒🌸:Another suggestion I have is more fonts.;🌸𝔸𝕚𝕪𝕒𝕟𝕒🌸:I do love some of the fonts you’ve provided us with, but I would love if there was a way we could upload our own fonts into the app.;🌸𝔸𝕚𝕪𝕒𝕟𝕒🌸:I’ve been thinking about this next suggestion for quite some time now, and I think it would be really effective and really improve this app!;🌸𝔸𝕚𝕪𝕒𝕟𝕒🌸:Maybe you could add a feature where we can make our own transitions?;🌸𝔸𝕚𝕪𝕒𝕟𝕒🌸:Now, I realize this might be a stretch, but hear me out: if we could make our own transitions, it would really increase our creativity skills.;🌸𝔸𝕚𝕪𝕒𝕟𝕒🌸:I know that other apps already have this feature, but I feel like CapCut is better, considering it’s 100% free!;🌸𝔸𝕚𝕪𝕒𝕟𝕒🌸:One more thing I’d like to mention.;🌸𝔸𝕚𝕪𝕒𝕟𝕒🌸:I was thinking you could add more mask shapes?;🌸𝔸𝕚𝕪𝕒𝕟𝕒🌸:Like maybe a feature where we could mask our own shapes?;🌸𝔸𝕚𝕪𝕒𝕟𝕒🌸:Ooh and maybe we could mask our clip and you could add a feature where we can have a glow effect around the masked area?;🌸𝔸𝕚𝕪𝕒𝕟𝕒🌸:Idk, it was just a thought.;🌸𝔸𝕚𝕪𝕒𝕟𝕒🌸:Well I hope you take some of these into consideration.;🌸𝔸𝕚𝕪𝕒𝕟𝕒🌸:Have a nice day!;setBgAni:bg_softIn 5s;setBgTransform:scale(1.15, 1.15) translate(-5%, 0);changeBg:c2.jpg

sound levels.;sdrakeofficial:I’d also love the ability to use an equalizer on any audio track individually along with audio filters (Having to extract audio from a video in order;sdrakeofficial:to add voice effects doesn’t count).;sdrakeofficial:This, along with the ability to change more render settings would be great.;sdrakeofficial:For example,changing the bitrate for the entirety of the video could be simplified using a slider that goes from “smaller size,lower quality”to “larger size,higher quality.;sdrakeofficial:The ability to render in the background would also be a much appreciated feature as a lot of us who use CapCut to edit do so on our main device that we need to access,and on larger projects it’s impossible to get a render done.;sdrakeofficial:Even older devices are capable of background rendering.;sdrakeofficial:I’m sure many people would be willing to wait for a slightly longer render in favor of being able to use their phone or tablet whilst the render is;sdrakeofficial:being completed.;sdrakeofficial:(An indicator can be used to signal whether the render is ongoing, has failed, or has finished).;sdrakeofficial:One last thing.;sdrakeofficial:Im sure many would enjoy a precision movement tool that allowed for things like key framing to be more precise when changing the size of location of a;sdrakeofficial:clip.;setBgAni:bg_down 5s;setBgTransform:scale(1.15, 1.15) translate(-5%, 0);changeBg:Loading_img.jpg -next;miniAvatar:ia_400000092.png -right -next;setFigAni:upin 1s

click add it says my storage is full😐 I am mad bc i delete and delete things but it says the same;tddttfttl:thing i power off my phone but it still says that and I can’t even edit.;tddttfttl:But other than that, it’s a pretty good app u can remove the watermark FOR FREE and most editing apps make you pay.;tddttfttl:It has decent effects filters etc. overlays are good and trimming is very easy for people that just started.;tddttfttl:I think it’s a great app for first timers it’s easy to use it’s not updated very much just bug fixes and a few new effects but everything is alright.;tddttfttl:It’s easy to add your own watermark too and many choices,you can make it look like vs which is cool and useful for those who get bullied for using CapCut.;tddttfttl:Speed and velocity are something that need a bit more work I say it’s not very smooth kinda laggy too,also we need more effects don’t get me wrong the ones we have are GREAT but I feel like they’re getting… old.;tddttfttl:It’s also good it’s not all presets unlike many other apps.;tddttfttl:But yeah my honest opinion about this is good;setBgAni:bg_softIn 5s;setBgFilter:blur(1px);changeBg:bg2.jpg

childish.;Ashley🤝:I've matured over the days, weeks, months, & years.;Ashley🤝:And here's my final (?) review I hope not to change because of accidents or just, childishness.;Ashley🤝:This app is overall good.;Ashley🤝:Sadly, there aren't any effects I'd hope to find.;Ashley🤝:But this is the most easiest app for editing I've seen.;Ashley🤝:So, that's fine.;Ashley🤝:Most of the transitions are good, some are meh…But it's fine if you don't mind that, and besides kinemaster it's so easy to use!;Ashley🤝:The exporting is way faster than kinemaster's. if you make a 2 minute video, it's done quickly.;Ashley🤝:But not in 10 seconds you actually need to wait.;Ashley🤝:But for kinemaster?;Ashley🤝:Pfft.;Ashley🤝:Don’t even get me started!;Ashley🤝:But, there is something that bothers me.;Ashley🤝:The zooming in.;Ashley🤝:Kinemaster's zooming is just amazing!;Ashley🤝:You can do memes with it and a bunch of other stuff(Zooming in for animations, gacha life, gacha club, etc.);Ashley🤝:But capcut's zooming kinda annoys me all the time I use it.;Ashley🤝:I use the key (I forgot what it's called, sorry.) thing to zoom in, but it turns out horrible.;Ashley🤝:And, yes.;Ashley🤝:Effects have zooming in, but those bother me too!;Ashley🤝:That's the only issue I have.;Ashley🤝:Buts that's all!;Ashley🤝:Goodbye capcut team, Keep up the good work.;setBgAni:bg_down

a rating of only 4.5.;Piemaker_Pri:It should be at least 4.8.;Piemaker_Pri:But just like any other video editing app (I should be sorry to say this lol) it has it’s flaws.;Piemaker_Pri:I want more filters, like an invert filter.;Piemaker_Pri:Also some people may not understand English so it may be a problem for them if they want a video editing app that could feature their language.;Piemaker_Pri:That also applies to the effects, filters, etc. So please, allow users to select their own language.;Piemaker_Pri:It could also be good if you could put a dark mode, be able to save your music, or SFX to the app, and name your video before you start your project.;Piemaker_Pri:This is all I have to say.;Piemaker_Pri:Hopefully CapCut listens to my review, so that all

then place them on the screen.;^Gamer^Bear^:They will look like little pictures that you would take out of a polaroid camera.;^Gamer^Bear^:Then once their music hits the beat drop then the zoom comes in.;^Gamer^Bear^:It will automatically zoom in to a random photo that the editor has chosen.;^Gamer^Bear^:Then their will be some shakes or other effects that will be given to make the edit look good.;^Gamer^Bear^:And the.;^Gamer^Bear^:It will zoom out of the picture and then zoom into another.;^Gamer^Bear^:This will happen 2-3 times.;^Gamer^Bear^:And yeah, that’s my idea thanks for

minutes long (XD).;danfanderp:But I do have a suggestion with the app creators: Could you please put in an option to start a template without having a video?;danfanderp:It would be a lot easier to

like titles in alight motion it would be great and maybe even pass alight motion,;dijwjsmxmalallaow:I think if there were graphs and making your own transitions would be

someone is planning on adding quite a few overlays to their videos its frustrating having to add them one at a time.;3lena9anuel:4: the abilty to add splice to text without having to make a video and

bakers:you can find out that CapCut itself actually is the cause of full storage,;ostrich bakers:delete it off CapCut after saving it so you can only access it in your video album,this prevents most

it,;ostrich bakers:Also there is a problem with the storage,;ostrich bakers:but I have found some solutions,;ostrich bakers:not the video itself,;ostrich bakers:It’s not easy to edit on top of it

pristine and smooth, so of course I’d want most of my videos to export as such!;HUGOlovesTRAINZ:A suggestion I’d love to see added into the app is effects being able to fade in and out,a lot of the effects have harsh cuts and I usually can only attach it to a frame to make it seem-less,I’d love to see the team add fading options in and out for the overlay effects that they give

have a lot of great fonts in this app,although I feel like we could use more Sans Serif or just Serif fonts to make it more regular but to really step it up.;clulessasif:Frankly,you can use the different language fonts in English sentences,I feel like to make our editing jobs more modern we could use more round,and bubbly fonts.;clulessasif:Example: Champagne & Limousines, Blacklisted, and etc. B- Animation Don’t get me wrong, the animations on this app are everything.;clulessasif:Even better than most transitional animations.;clulessasif:However, I feel as though we need graphs to make our own video animations.;clulessasif:-Sincerely,Anonymous P.;clulessasif:Font animations are okay,but I feel like it’d be cooler to add the same animations for the fonts as the pictures have.;clulessasif:- I know this update would take a while,but you’d benefit off of it.;clulessasif:Trust me xx;setBgAni:bg_down 5s;setBgFilter:blur(1px);changeBg:c4.jpg

it’s awesome !;sghsshbs:I love all the cool effects on this app but it can cause a little bit of trouble depending on what device your using to edit ....;sghsshbs:If your a person who doesn’t really care for small differences on the quality of apps then this is just right for you !;sghsshbs:It has many cool features you can even add your favorite music to your edits I’ve only had it for about 2

app.;Wavewasher:I made so many edits and videos by using this.;Wavewasher:There are so many things you can do in this app!;Wavewasher:So many different combinations you can choose from and make your videos unique.;Wavewasher:Although, I have 2 small requests that would make this better 1.;Wavewasher:I love making AMVs but when I insert GIFs, it just becomes a photo from a random scene in a GIF.;Wavewasher:I would really appreciate if you would let GIFs actually be GIFs instead of just photos 2.;Wavewasher:It would be cool if you could change the pitch without changing the speed.;Wavewasher:I also like making cosplay videos with music in the background and I like to make it look like the character is singing it.;Wavewasher:But, there are only so many versions of a song you can find on the internet.;Wavewasher:If you don’t get what I mean, take the song Control for example.;Wavewasher:All the male covers of the song is high and the character I’m relating to has a deep voice.;Wavewasher:I made the video slower, but I can’t make it too slow or it would look weird.;Wavewasher:I hope that makes sense.;Wavewasher:Other than that, I would defiantly

echo laughter,etc.;Cute wolf_2678:(Sorry if that doesn’t make sense) :’) For transitions,you can add a different icon that says “Transition Effects”.;Cute wolf_2678:This icon can have things such as oscillate!;Cute wolf_2678:And with that, I feel like CapCut can be an even greater app!;Cute wolf_2678:Now, one last suggestion: For the text, maybe try and make text fonts that are much more unique.;Cute wolf_2678:Anyways, those are some of the suggestions I would like for your next update in the future.;Cute wolf_2678:That is, of course if you get a new update.;setBgAni:bg_down

suggestion is that you should add 3d space,that could make it more like after effects and more like Funimate and overall just better edits so please consider that and also maybe more effects like the displace effect from tiktok and more filters like the ones fan pages use.;ma123 abc:Also maybe a community page that we can share our edits on and also templates instead of shortcuts and maybe people can create templates because that;ma123 abc:would be cool because then people can do it and it could be a trend.;ma123 abc:Overall a really good app and capable of a lot of things!;ma123 abc:Just

1.;anya 😌:Graphs!!;anya 😌:I feel like if you add graphs it will be more confusing,but If you make it just a simple graph mechanic it will be simple and easy,although you should make it an options in settings to do advanced and what advanced will mean like to be able to do graphs or not.;anya 😌:Graphs will just make edits a lot smoother.;anya 😌:Being able to import text fonts!;anya 😌:There is a pretty wide variety of fonts, but it would be even better if we could import our own.;anya 😌:More transitions!;anya 😌:Anyways thats all.;anya 😌:But 5/5 i do recommend this app.;anya 😌:Very user

𖦹ͻ:So,sometimes I will play the video back to myself to make sure it looks and sounds fine,or I will go to my exported audios and choose one I wanna add to my video.;Swirl Rose 𖦹ͻ:When I do that, the audio starts to sound different.;Swirl Rose 𖦹ͻ:The difference between the original and this other version is that in this version,if there were voices in the audio before,then the voices are all gone

app.;tessssssmmmmmmm:I have been using it for a year now and have been able to make great things.;tessssssmmmmmmm:There are a couple features I hope can be added.;tessssssmmmmmmm:First of all we need to be able to add multiple animations to one clip.;tessssssmmmmmmm:Currently I can’t fade in and then fade out the clip.;tessssssmmmmmmm:I also can’t fade out a clip that has a fancier animation.;tessssssmmmmmmm:I would love if i was able to favorite animations and apply the same animation to all clips.;tessssssmmmmmmm:I would also like if the speed tool was better.;tessssssmmmmmmm:Currently slowing down clips is very glitchy.;tessssssmmmmmmm:Another suggestion is to add more font choices, especially ones similar to higher paying programs.;tessssssmmmmmmm:It would be great if I could import fonts.;tessssssmmmmmmm:You recently updated the camera focus effect and blur effect so that you can speed it up and add more blur but it’s still not the same.;tessssssmmmmmmm:I would like for it to be able to look the same for shorter clips as I use that a lot.;tessssssmmmmmmm:This way I can make edits that look more professional.;tessssssmmmmmmm:I would like for me to be able to add multiple colors to the chroma key.;tessssssmmmmmmm:I would like to be able to add multiple effects and animations to text and clips.;tessssssmmmmmmm:And maybe something to improve the quality of my videos.;tessssssmmmmmmm:Those are some of my recommendations.;tessssssmmmmmmm:Some of the fonts show the fonts in another language.;tessssssmmmmmmm:I would like for all of the fonts to be shown in the language i have set on the app or phone, for me English.;tessssssmmmmmmm:My only other criticism is that it can be glitchy.;tessssssmmmmmmm:Sometimes when I try to watch my video it pauses on a certain part and unfreezes later in the video.;tessssssmmmmmmm:Although I do appreciate the lack of ads.;tessssssmmmmmmm:In conclusion I do love this app.;tessssssmmmmmmm:Please look at my suggestions I believe many people would benefit from them!!;setBgAni:bg_down

star for ease of use.;DBGs LLC:Another star because the logo can be removed on your phones editing software.;DBGs LLC:I did not rate this 4 stars because it has locked out features I couldn’t test.;DBGs LLC:I didn’t rate this 5 stars because it has a logo at the end of every project.;DBGs LLC:Which I hate the most and would have rated it 1 star.;DBGs LLC:My biggest peeves on ANY item doesn’t matter who the company is and I’m not pointing at anyone.;DBGs LLC:But I hate on any product of whoever it may be at the time I hate locked out features and logos.;DBGs LLC:Based on if I’m doing a something important to show for school or something for work the end logo could fail the project.;DBGs LLC:OR locked out features could be the key of adding that special twist that I couldn’t get.;DBGs LLC:So I wouldn’t rate it for schools or work.;DBGs LLC:This solely based at Home Use Only.;DBGs LLC:And that is where this product really shines the most in my book.;DBGs LLC:What I’m saying is you can add videos from anywhere just don’t use for school or work.;DBGs LLC:If your doing projects on major stuff the logo will be it.;DBGs LLC:But this is removable IF you use your phone to edit that out.;DBGs LLC:If you do that.;DBGs LLC:And only if you do that.;DBGs LLC:I could see it cleared for school and work.;DBGs LLC:If they remove the auto logo appearing at the end then it just might rank up on my favorites list.;DBGs LLC:But all features must be unlocked with no logo to make that list.;DBGs LLC:It IS on my recommendation list.;DBGs LLC:So try this out.;DBGs

with an easy to navigate system, so many features and options, and everything available! 1.;WoopWoopHidroFlask!:First off I’d like to point out how excellent the system is.;WoopWoopHidroFlask!:Every option and control is easy to use, forgoing overwhelming amount of possibilities.;WoopWoopHidroFlask!:speeding up or slowing down the video,adding effects and animation,adding text,cropping the video,or transitioning between clips) would be impossibly difficult to implement,however once I (quickly) learned my way around the app I found it was extremely simple!;WoopWoopHidroFlask!:At first I was concerned that some of the options (e.;WoopWoopHidroFlask!:Usually these kinds of editing apps confuse me and make we want to punch a window,with all the complex options with multiple options off those options.;WoopWoopHidroFlask!:Options on top of options!!;WoopWoopHidroFlask!:(See!;WoopWoopHidroFlask!:I probably made your brain hurt just thinking about it!!);WoopWoopHidroFlask!:Differing from these mind boggling systems,CapCut provides so many options,but arranges them in a system I find easy to learn,simple to navigate,and fun to use!;WoopWoopHidroFlask!:Second, I’d like to applaud you guys for not including a subscription, extra pay add-ons, or limited features which require an upgrade!;WoopWoopHidroFlask!:When I first opened this app I instantly assumed I would be bombarded by “Pay for this and you’ll get that!”;WoopWoopHidroFlask!:“Get premium and get all this!”;WoopWoopHidroFlask!:Or “To get started, begin your subscription!”;WoopWoopHidroFlask!:However, I was met with a pleasant surprise; no subscription ads!;WoopWoopHidroFlask!:My brain then began to ponder what I would have to pay for.;WoopWoopHidroFlask!:What was the catch?;WoopWoopHidroFlask!:I cautiously began to use the app, expecting something to pop up saying “now you have to pay!”;WoopWoopHidroFlask!:But in fact there is NO CATCH!;WoopWoopHidroFlask!:After getting the app, I didn’t have to pay for a thing!;WoopWoopHidroFlask!:How exciting is that?;WoopWoopHidroFlask!:Thank you for not creating a subscription-binding app!!! 3.;WoopWoopHidroFlask!:Finally, I’d like to thank you guys for your hard work in creating such a pristine app.;WoopWoopHidroFlask!:The effects are smooth and clean, without the unwanted fuzziness and glitches.;WoopWoopHidroFlask!:I was pleasantly surprised by the high quality edits I was able to implement.;WoopWoopHidroFlask!:The amount of money people pay to get high quality editing tools is insane!;WoopWoopHidroFlask!:Yet you guys give us an easy to use, high quality, all out amazing editing app for nearly nothing!;WoopWoopHidroFlask!:In conclusion, I’m in love with your app, and I can’t wait to use it even more!;WoopWoopHidroFlask!:As there’s always room for improvement,;WoopWoopHidroFlask!:the option to cut the songs down (maybe this is already possible I’m not sure) but every time I add music to my little short videos that are like 10-12 seconds long,;WoopWoopHidroFlask!:leaving me with a lot of blank space.;WoopWoopHidroFlask!:I would suggest just a minor addition;;WoopWoopHidroFlask!:there’s always an excess of song at the end,;WoopWoopHidroFlask!:Allowing users to cut down the songs would be awesome and greatly appreciated.;WoopWoopHidroFlask!:Otherwise, this app is really cool, and I’m proud to be a user! -Thanks! -Darkpuppy, age 14.;setBgAni:bg_down 5s;setBgTransform:scale(1.15, 1.15) translate(-5%,

-next;setFigAni:centerin 1s -right;jsisysbsksushshs:Problems I encountered: 1.;jsisysbsksushshs:A limit on animation;it would be nice if there were more options with animation,but a problem I encountered as well is that there aren't matching animations,for example: Yoyo 1 only goes to the right direction.;jsisysbsksushshs:I feel if you're going to make an animation that goes to one direction there should be another that goes to the other direction as well,like Yoyo 2 should go to the left,(Including other animations as well).;jsisysbsksushshs:In and Out;I also believe that combo animations aren't enough,In animations and Out animations should be able to work on the same clip together,not just one per clip.;jsisysbsksushshs:Overlays;There shouldn't be a limit to how many overlays someone can put,it might be because the app starts to lag a bit,(which is fine,I’m still able to edit),but then you should be able to fix that issue in order to allow a person to put limitless overlays.;jsisysbsksushshs:-Another issue with text (similar to the In and Out issue) the In and Out of the text should be able to function and work while I have a Loop,so,the Loop can start after the In of the text and stop when it's Out.;jsisysbsksushshs:Text;Whenever I animate a text,for some reason after a while of editing it stops doing the animations it's supposed to,for example: I put sunrise animation for the intro and slide down for the outro,but it dissapears after a while,so I have to tap on the text and exit it again.;jsisysbsksushshs:Transitions; Mostly a specific one, and that's the Slide transitions.;jsisysbsksushshs:It covers up the beginning of the animation of a clip.;jsisysbsksushshs:Less than one second; unable to put transitions on a clip if it’s less than one, I feel as if that should be doable.;jsisysbsksushshs:Ideas: 1.;jsisysbsksushshs:Adding keyframes, this could help more with the creativity on the app.;jsisysbsksushshs:More transitions, for example: splits, tiles (tile shift/tile rotate).;setBgAni:bg_down 5s;setBgTransform:scale(1.15, 1.15) translate(-5%, 0);changeBg:bg.png -next;miniAvatar:ia_600000126.png -right

more stickers because;❤️❤️say so🦄🦄:those are kind of old just to me but other than that it’s such a great app I really recommend it it’s very easy;❤️❤️say so🦄🦄:to edit with and I can’t edit with any

it’s really easy to use I think it won’t be the best for pros because I;❤️❤️say so🦄🦄:think they will find it too easy and also they might find it too boring because there aren’t that many effects or

me!;*-🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋-*:I came across capcut on YouTube and decided to download it!;*-🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋-*:So,I got it, and what I learned was it is superrrrr helpful to beginners!;*-🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋-*:It’s easy to learn and you could delete the watermark for free!;*-🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋-*:But there is something that I would like to address.;*-🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋-*:The “no storage” feature.;*-🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋-*:anyways back to what I was saying it is super annoying especially when I press the plus button to import the pictures for a video it says “no;*-🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋-*:storage”or when I record music for a video and press the plus button it says “;*-🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋-*:I wouldn’t really call it a “feature”but it is a feature in the app so I will call it that,;*-🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋-*:no storage”it is very annoying because I keep deleting so much of my apps and data.;*-🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋-*:I almost have no more apps anymore!;*-🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋-*:I only have 3 actual apps and those are for animating, editing, and drawing.;*-🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋-*:Please I’m begging make it not need so much storage if that’s even possible!;*-🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋-*:But another problem that I have is the slow-motion quality.;*-🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋-*:It is definitely not the best but it’s not worse then some I’ve seen.;*-🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋-*:Even when I put “smoother quality” it doesn’t really look like it.;*-🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋-*:I use a different app for slow-motion because of this problem.;*-🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋-*:I’m not saying it’s a major problem and I might be the only person complaining about it even with the new update,but it’s just my opinion and you can always get it if you want!;*-🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋-*:There is one last thing I would like to address.;*-🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋-*:The chroma key.;*-🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋-*:It is not the best at making things transparent… for example there where two totally different colors I used for text and a background to import in;*-🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋-*:one of my edits and while I used chroma key the white disappeared with the green?;*-🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋-*:I don’t know if that was a glitch or I’m color blind, because those are two totally different colors.;*-🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋-*:I have no idea why it did that but I had to just go with a different color!;*-🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋-*:Please fix that, it was annoying because I spent time on the text and it just erased and went transparent and blank in the end.;*-🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋-*:By all the things I said so far where just tiny complaints that I have.;*-🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋-*:So, I’m not here to tell people what to complain for!;*-🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋-*:You should definitely install this app if your a beginner.;*-🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋-*:Like I said in the start very simple and easy to learn from!;*-🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋-*:But you don’t need to if you wouldn’t like to!;*-🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋-*:That will rap it up for my review!;*-🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋-*:I hope anyone who read this far has a good morning/evening/night!!;setBgAni:bg_softIn

the potential of programs.;PushtheButtonStudios:Capcut is the only app to convince me otherwise!;PushtheButtonStudios:Heck premiere cannot even motion track.;PushtheButtonStudios:But this editor, strives in every category, pushing every boundary.;PushtheButtonStudios:Except One, resolution output.;PushtheButtonStudios:1080p output is the only weakness.;PushtheButtonStudios:But this

1080p screen capture output.;PushtheButtonStudios:( not freeze frame),output frame to gallery.;PushtheButtonStudios:This feature would make this app and all in one

(which are still only available in apps).;PushtheButtonStudios:(called [3d zoom and 3d zoom pr… within this app).;PushtheButtonStudios:Final mention;The [style] featured (possible on freeze frames) effects like what is referred as picture morphing parallax.;PushtheButtonStudios:IS INCREDIBLE.;PushtheButtonStudios:No other attempts made by programmers have even come close to what is pulled off

change on the app is to enhance the audio choices.;ærñv:I love the audio choices there are now but I feel like there could be more.;ærñv:I also like how you can access your songs you have on a playlist or just a song in general.;ærñv:One thing you could do to change the sound choices is to add a search bar.;ærñv:An editor could search for a specific song instead of look at all of your choices.;ærñv:Plus if an editor has a time limit on the video like say they have 7 hours to complete the edit and send it back to the creator l just going to the;ærñv:search bar and finding a specific song it would save the editor some crucial time.;ærñv:I love CapCut because it lets your creative juices flow with no limit.;ærñv:Before I downloaded the app and I was reading some reviews.;ærñv:A couple of reviews said that the storage on the app wasn’t very good.;ærñv:I have not yet experienced that problem but I do throw out some of my older edits.;ærñv:Thank you CapCut

overlays.;tritty bear:But when I used it, it looked, well… like an old piece of paper from 1832 that was cut out.;tritty bear:I used ibisPaint x to edit it, and it looked like what I said.;tritty bear:(No offense to the creators of ibisPaint x!) maybe you could make the overlays that were edited from ibisPaint x look a little more newer.;tritty bear:Now to things I suggest.;tritty bear:I really think your should make a little drawing button to those who can’t get ibisPaint or ibisPaint x.;tritty bear:Next thing I think you should add is pet stickers and hand stickers,and a custom

tt:One thing that I totally recommend is for the text to be updated.;@yourfavweirdo on tt:By this I mean that it would be good if we could edit word by word when we type a phrase.;@yourfavweirdo on tt:This would also save a lot of time.;@yourfavweirdo on tt:Also I noticed that on android devices that you can now add your own fonts from websites like “dafont.com”;@yourfavweirdo on tt:and was wondering if that update will be coming to IOS.;@yourfavweirdo on tt:Also a few new fonts would be great!;@yourfavweirdo on tt:I totally recommend the font “Lemon Milk”.;@yourfavweirdo on tt:Another thing I think would be good is if you guys made a velocity feature to slow down clips or made your speed feature a bit smoother.;@yourfavweirdo on tt:This would all really help make my edits a whole lot better.;setBgAni:bg_softIn 5s;setBgTransform:scale(1.15, 1.15) translate(-5%, 0);changeBg:bg.png -next;miniAvatar:ia_600000101.png -right -next;setFigAni:shake 1s

love the shakes transition and other stuff .;🌼mya🌼:So my first suggestion is we should have a thing we’re you can make an velocity edit I know video star already have this but you have to pay but if;🌼mya🌼:y’all make velocity thing then we can get it for free .;🌼mya🌼:And I know we got something like a thing that makes your video go fast and slow but I feel like the thing like video star would be better.;🌼mya🌼:next more fonts I don’t really have nothing to say about fonts but yea we just need more fonts.;🌼mya🌼:Next more animations like a hard zigzag shake or something Yall can think of .;🌼mya🌼:Next y’all should make something like when we can add more than one animation than making another project and add the animation then go back to the;🌼mya🌼:original project an add the 2nd project and then add another animation.;🌼mya🌼:Next you guys should add more stock videos like green screens of cards,Pokémon ball,laptops,and more you guys can think of.;🌼mya🌼:Next more filters

frames sometimes when I post my edit it’s always a cube shape and I cannot fix it there is no option for me to have another;lesinoa:picture frame rate.;lesinoa:Next is the quality so I made a edit and it was a HD quality video and I selected the frame rate 50 and the quality 2k and when I exported it and;lesinoa:posted it on YouTube it came out as 480p I do not know if it’s because of YouTube or CapCut.;lesinoa:Another.;lesinoa:Suggestion is more smooth transitions there are a lot of smooth ones but I feel you egoism maybe make a setting to change it to like pro editors for;lesinoa:us to make some more smoother edits.;lesinoa:I also suggest more stock videos for like intros!;lesinoa:That’s all I love this app and definitely recommend;setBgAni:bg_softIn

edits and I honestly appreciate the app for;Fallen_Dreamz:helping me get more experienced in getting creative.;Fallen_Dreamz:Edits can be so much more than just slapping a couple of pre-made transitions and calling it a day if you just experiment with your options a lot;Fallen_Dreamz:more.;Fallen_Dreamz:I actually find it fun editing in CC rather than frustrating or exhausting.;Fallen_Dreamz:Sure, it may take an hour, an entire day or an entire night to get it done but it’s definitely worth it if you enjoy it.;Fallen_Dreamz:The mechanics are easy to understand and most of the time things don’t get messy (such as undoing a keyframe and having the clip zoomed in,or adjusting the masking and having it stuck in at a certain limit,or editing an overlay with a splice added and having the outside completely black.;Fallen_Dreamz:Those were just some nitpicks.;Fallen_Dreamz:Oh, and a major issue to me is the lag depending on how complex the edit is or how much overlays are included.;Fallen_Dreamz:Not only does the preview freeze, the audio glitches out real bad.;Fallen_Dreamz:I’m currently typing this out just right when I updated the app right when I began this review.;Fallen_Dreamz:So hopefully that issue might’ve been dealt with, or at least some of the others.;Fallen_Dreamz:I don’t really have much to say, but it’s overall positivity about the app.;Fallen_Dreamz:Now, about the new template feature.;Fallen_Dreamz:Template Feature: I’m not sure as to why this is,but Android users seem to be the only people able to access the ability to create templates and view others while iOS users (such as myself) can only use templates from the Shortcut area.;Fallen_Dreamz:I’m hoping that at some point this feature will release for iPhone users, I think it’d be fun creating templates for others to use!;Fallen_Dreamz:That’s just one possibility.;Fallen_Dreamz:Either it’s only actually available for Android users or the iPhone I’m using is too outdated to be able to create templates.;Fallen_Dreamz:Which I hope isn’t the case.;Fallen_Dreamz:This is much more short, but it was the main reason why I wrote down this review.;Fallen_Dreamz:I just thought I should include my actual thoughts on the app entirely as well.;Fallen_Dreamz:That’s all from me, thank you for reading and please excuse any grammatical errors

pass.;questing_rice:And it's the only app I have to make edits 🥲🥲 Anyways, I also want to talk about the bad things about capcut.;questing_rice:I don't know if anyone gets this but when I am in the editing process, the transitions that I make are perfectly lined up with the beat.;questing_rice:But, when I save it, it goes way off beat.;questing_rice:This only happened when I had the app for like 2 weeks then it started doing this.;questing_rice:The beat marker system.;questing_rice:Though it would be hard considering this is an app for mobile use,when i'm trying to mark the beats of an audio and the audio has fast beats,it would delete the beat I made previously before the beat,making it harder.;questing_rice:Key frames.;questing_rice:I really like the use of key frames, but I think it may can use a little upgrading.;questing_rice:When I use a key frame without any transitions, it looks weird and a little robotic.;questing_rice:I was expecting more of a flowy movement, but it was just robotic and stiff, you know?;questing_rice:When I use it with a transition, it makes the transition look weirder.;questing_rice:Like the transitions become more robotic and not as flowy.;questing_rice:And, I think that key frames can also customize the transition being put onto the video.;questing_rice:So let's say we use a key frame for the beginning of a video.;questing_rice:And one at the end.;questing_rice:We can use a little bar that can control the transition amount at the end of the key frame so it can be a little like what we want.;questing_rice:Animation Extension.;questing_rice:I think it would be cool if we can make movements in images.;questing_rice:Like a photo of someone and then the arm is moving.;questing_rice:Or a photo of an anime character and we make their mouth move.;questing_rice:I guess we can kind of do that, but we would need multiple apps too do that.;questing_rice:Also, we can make the photos wavy after a transition between 2 photos.;questing_rice:And then add like a bounce effect after that.;questing_rice:And, we can distort the photos with the song.;questing_rice:So for example, during a part of a song, we pull on someone's eye ball, and it distorts that in the direction of where you pull it.;questing_rice:But it would be better if you had like a certain section for that.And finally 5.;questing_rice:Custom Filters.;questing_rice:When I mean custom filters, i'm talking about 2 things.;questing_rice:One, how fast a certain filter goes.;questing_rice:So let's say the Back Flash filter from the Party section.;questing_rice:We can customize to make the back flash go faster than usual or slower than usual.;questing_rice:And two, we can change the "noise level" (grainy photos).;questing_rice:I'm so sorry for the long review but I really hope that you can look over this :)) 🥰🥰;setBgAni:bg_down

using multiple apps to edit videos for years, and this app makes editing and transitions very easy and accessible and I super appreciate it!;OreoKween:But I have just one suggestion that may really well round the app out!;OreoKween:With transitions,sometimes they stop a bit abruptly when it gets to the end of the transition time,but there are things that could be implemented that could offer more for the people on the fence about which app to use!;OreoKween:Something that could fix, or at least customize, how the transition ends could be if there was a transition curve added to the app!;OreoKween:It doesn’t necessarily need to be the type that a person can specifically alter every aspect of the transition rate,but perhaps a dozen set curves to get people started!;OreoKween:I great example of this kind of thing can be seen of CuteCut or CuteCutPro,when you make a transition and scroll to the right of the transition options,it gives set transition curves to smooth,bounce,or alter the curve of the transition,which makes them smoother most of the time!;OreoKween:I’m not sure how much of a pain in the butt this would be to implement, but I wanted to mention it!;setBgAni:bg_down 5s;setBgFilter:blur(1px);changeBg:bg3.jpg -next;miniAvatar:ia_700000096.png -left -next;setFigAni:shake 1s -left;Hands and soap:You helped me so much this app is so ez and

mastered this app completely and don’t want to leave and switch over to something that’s paid when capcut is doing things that every;Grandmaster Marti:other editing service is doing.;Grandmaster Marti:However, there is always room to grow, especially for the editors who’s skills are growing faster and wanting more.;Grandmaster Marti:A few of my recommendations is having more advanced and better options for speed.;Grandmaster Marti:Please add more filters (specifically in the border area),and add ones that are different and will give our videos good quality(I’m pretty sure y’all can come up with something!;Grandmaster Marti:I ask that we get more font options and allow us to use more than 1 animation for out fonts PLEASEE!!;Grandmaster Marti:Those are just a few of my recommendations.;Grandmaster Marti:Now,on to my concerns the app does lag a little,and constantly says that I’m out of storage and I delete a lot of previous edits just to make new ones,and I’m getting concerned that the app will just not be enough for me.;Grandmaster Marti:It’s already taken up most of my storage andI really want it to be worth it,but all these glitches,lags,and thirst for storage is not going to make using this app worth it.;Grandmaster Marti:I hope someone sees this, and I hope you have a great rest of your day/night.;setBgAni:bg_softIn

everything is free and how you can remove the watermark at the end.;jasᵔᴥᵔ◡̈:so my first recommendation is that you guys should maybe add more animations to both,texts and clips.;jasᵔᴥᵔ◡̈:i know there's a lot of choices already but i mean that maybe if possible,there could be combos like there is for clips.i think itd look great on edits and would be very useful.;jasᵔᴥᵔ◡̈:maybe you could even add more combos as well.;jasᵔᴥᵔ◡̈:and now for clips,i think if you could add more ins and out transitions,it would be fun to be able to have more transitions.;jasᵔᴥᵔ◡̈:i do have some recommendations though because i do find some little issues or something i would like to be better/fixed.;jasᵔᴥᵔ◡̈:I have been using this app for like a year now and i think its great and easy to use.;jasᵔᴥᵔ◡̈:for the texts,i think itd be cool to have more varieties to choose from.;jasᵔᴥᵔ◡̈:id also think a new great addition would be if there were to be more shakes and stuff.;jasᵔᴥᵔ◡̈:sometimes when i make it slower,it looks blury or just doesnt look like it has the same quality as it would with normal speed.;jasᵔᴥᵔ◡̈:i do hsve more recommendations id like to share but i dont really know exactly how to explain it but if you could add/fix those things,i think the app would be 5x better!;jasᵔᴥᵔ◡̈:another suggestion is to make the speed adjusts cleaner.;jasᵔᴥᵔ◡̈:I dont think theres many shakes to add to your edits so i think more would be cool.;setBgAni:bg_down 5s;setBgTransform:scale(1.15, 1.15) translate(-5%, 0);changeBg:bg-small.jpg

or vintage ones have to be my favorite!;Lol_what_the_heck:Also the in and out animations are cool, and there are some that are for the whole duration of the video/photo, which is cool.;Lol_what_the_heck:The customization abilities for the text are great.;Lol_what_the_heck:You can give the text a font,color,some special design (example: making it glow) in and out

to mention.;🌸𝔸𝕚𝕪𝕒𝕟𝕒🌸:I was thinking you could add more mask shapes?;🌸𝔸𝕚𝕪𝕒𝕟𝕒🌸:Like maybe a feature where we could mask our own shapes?;🌸𝔸𝕚𝕪𝕒𝕟𝕒🌸:Ooh and maybe we could mask our clip and you could add a feature where we can have a glow effect around the masked area?;🌸𝔸𝕚𝕪𝕒𝕟𝕒🌸:Idk, it was just a thought.;🌸𝔸𝕚𝕪𝕒𝕟𝕒🌸:Well I hope you take some of these into consideration.;🌸𝔸𝕚𝕪𝕒𝕟𝕒🌸:Have a nice
